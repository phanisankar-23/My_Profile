    <h2>My Projects</h2>

    <div>
        <h3>Vision Based Text Recognition Using Raspberry pi</h3>
        <p>Developed a system using a Raspberry Pi module to manage text extraction from images and convert the
        extracted text to speech. This process enables visually impaired individuals to access written content through
        audio output. Image-to-speech conversion is a promising technology that enhances interaction with visual
        information for blind and visually impaired users.</p>

    <div>
        <h3>CrickConnect</h3>
        <p>CrickConnect is a front-end web application developed using HTML and CSS. The project provides information
            about upcoming cricket tournaments and allows player registration. It includes multiple pages such as Home,
            Tournaments, Registration, and Contact. The website is designed with a clean layout and basic responsive styling.
            This mini project helped me understand webpage structure and styling using HTML and CSS.</p>
